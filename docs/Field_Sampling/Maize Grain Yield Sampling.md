# Corn Grain Yield Sampling

???+ note
	This Methodology has issues and will likely be replaced soon

## Background

Most farmers have yield measuring combines that can track yield spatially, but on farms that do not have modern combines, yield data must be collected manually. The goal of this methodology is to obtain spatially attributed corn grain yield data effectively and quickly

## Before Going to the Field
### Generating Sample Points
In order to achieve statistical rigor, sampling points must be randomly placed across the study area, which is ideally stratified along some relevant parameter (NDVI), to ensure adequate representation across all represented areas. Additionally, if there are experimental/control areas, ensure points are generated in both. For now, points can be generated in qgis or ArcGIS, however an automated sample generator will be built soon.

### Preparing Sample Collection Bags

*Note: paper bags are located in the equipment room*

Sequentially label all bags with relevant information:

* Project (OFE, CURC)

* Year

* Field/Farm

* Measurement (Grain/Biomass)

* Sample #

## In the Field 

Use the Arrow or Emlid GPS receiver to navigate to each point. Collect **5** corn cobs from within 1 meter of the point. Place harvested cobs in pre labeled bag and take [TSNT](TSNT_Corn_Sampling.md) sample if necessary.
